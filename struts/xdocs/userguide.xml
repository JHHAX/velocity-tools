    <section name="Velocity for Struts User Guide">

        <p>
        This user guide describes how Struts application are built using Velocity
        as the view technologie. Application examples illustrate the different
        steps involved in building an application. This guide addresses both,
        the frontend designer as well as the backend developer. The section <a href="#Velocity vs. Struts">Velocity vs. JSP</a> is designed to help existing Struts/Velocity users get started with Velocity. This document is not a general introduction to Velocity. If you are new to Velocity, please consult <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/getting-started.html">Getting Started</a>.

        [Issues to be addressed here:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Model 2 Application</strong> Concepts, links to relevant reading, 
          help people think the right way about Velocity/Struts, emphasize that model 1 
          applications are not possible with Velocity as the view technologie.</li>

          <li><strong>Velocity Context</strong> What is it, access to the 
          request/session and application attributes, how to pass data from model to 
          view.</li>

          <li><strong>Velocity vs. JSP</strong> A comparison of the Struts custom JSP tags 
          with the Velocity tools. This should help JSP developers familiar with the

    <section name="Model 2 Architectures">
        <p>In the JSP world, the terms <i>Model 1</i> architectures and <i>Model 2</i> architectures were coined to refer to particular ways of designing and building web applications. It is important that you understand the fundamental difference between these two architectural approaches. JSP can be used in applications designed after Model 1 architectures as well as Model 2 architectures. Velocity cannot. It has been designed very consciouly as a view technology for web application architectures based on Model 2.</p>

        <p><strong>Model 1 Architectures</strong></p>        
        <p>In a Model 1 architecture, the JSP page alone is responsible for processing the incoming request and replying back to the client. Using MVC speak, the controller and the view  are implemented within the same JSP page. Model 1 architecture are suitable only for very simple application scenarios. In medium size to large projects, the lack of a separation between business logic and view oftentimes leads to difficulties in separating the web designer's works from the server developer's work and causes project management headaches.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Model 2 Architectures</strong></p>        
        <p>In a Model 2 architecture, the control component, including business logic, data access and request handling, are strictly separated from the view component. The view does not contain any processing logic. It is simply responsible for displaying the data that resulted from processing the request. This may be a static page or more often a dynamic page. Such an approach typically facilitates are clear delineation of the roles and responsibilities of the developers and the web designers. The more complex an application, the greater the benefits of using a Model 2 architecture will be.</p>
        
        <p>The paper <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-1999/jw-12-ssj-jspmvc.html">Understanding JavaServer Pages Model 2 Architecture</a> provides a more in-depth discussion of Model 1 and Model 2 architectures.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p>        
        <p>The Struts framework can support both architectures, but all the facilities it provides are really aimed at making the construction of Model 2 applications easy. Velocity on the other hand cannot be used to build Model 1 architectures. It lacks the libraries to support such a design. I am emphasizing this here because I want to make sure that you have all the relevant facts before you decide on Velocity for your projects. This is especially important for people considering to port existing application built on the Model 1 approach or a mixed Model 1 / Model 2 approach. The good news is, that today for any serious application Model 2 is state of the art and Velocity will support you very well on that route.</p>

    <section name="Building Applications">

        <p>This section introduces you to the key concepts of building Struts applications with Velocity as the view technology.</p>

    
        <subsection name="Velocity Template Language">

            <p>Velocity is a template engine implemented in Java. Velocity templates typically are HTML pages with embedded scripts (although Velocity has been used for many other application scenarios). Scripts are written in the Velocity Template Language (VTL). Following is a simple example of a HTML view with embedded VTL statements:</p>
            
<sourcecode>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
    &lt;h2>Order Confirmation&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;Delivery Adress:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
    Name: $customer.name&lt;br&gt;
    Street: $customer.street&lt;br&gt;
    City: $customer.zip $customer.city
    
    &lt;h3&gt;Ordered Items&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
    #foreach( $item in $order.items )
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;$item.quantity&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;$item.description&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    #end
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;                
</sourcecode>

            <p>When processed this will produce output similar to the following.</p>

<sourcecode>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
    &lt;h2>Order Confirmation&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;Delivery Adress:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
    Name: Peter Pan&lt;br&gt;
    Street: Crain St. 10&lt;br&gt;
    City: 60201 Evanston IL
    
    &lt;h3&gt;Ordered Items&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Hair Dryer, Philips, 1000W, white&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Kitchen Mixer, Betty Bossy, 240W, black&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;                
</sourcecode>

            
            
            <p>VTL has been designed from the ground up as a simple template scriting language aimed at view designers. With less than ten supported directives it is easy to learn. In fact, most people are up and productive within less than a day.</p>
            
            <p>As opposed to JSP, Velocity does not allow Java scriptlets. Java scriptlets tempt designers to put business logic into the templates and have proven many times to be            problematic rather than useful. Using VTL, Java scriptlets can be avoided alltogether.</p>
            
            <p>Please consult the following two documents for an in-depth coverage of VTL:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/user-guide.html">Velocity User's Guide</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/vtl-reference-guide.html">VTL Reference Guide</a></li>
            </ul>
                        
            <p>To bring Velocity templates really to live, application data needs to be fed. The next section describes how this is done.</p>
            
        </subsection>

        <subsection name="Passing Application Data">

            <p>The main purpose of Velocity in a web application is typically to merge HTML templates with dynamic application data to generate dynamic views. An essential aspect of Velocity is therefore the mechanism that allows the application controller (in MVC speak) to pass application data to the template.</p> 
            
            <p>In this context it is important to understand the relationship between a Struts-based application and the Velocity template engine. Both, a Struts application as well as the Velocity template engine are each a Java Servlet. A request to the Struts application is processed and finally handed over, along with application data, to the Velocity servlet to generate the view. I'd like to add here that the Velocity servlet is not exclusively tied to the Struts application. It can serve requests from web clients directly or any other servlet application as well. Technically, Struts hands over a request to Velocity through method <code>forward</code> of <code>javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher</code>. </p>
            
            <p>Application data is passed from the Struts servlet to the Velocity servlet as attributes of either the servlet request, the servlet session or the servlet context </p>

            <p></p>

            <p></p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Since the Struts framework was designed to be used with several different view techhnologies (JSP, template engines, XML/XSL, JSF, etc.) it makes the  
            
            
            
            has defined an approach that is based on the Servlet API.
