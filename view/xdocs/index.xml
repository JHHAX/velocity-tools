    <p>
    Velocity View for Struts is the first non-JSP view layer to take advantage
    of the new Struts ContextHelper.  The ContextHelper is an object exposed
    by Struts that allows any Java-based view technology access to Struts
    resources.
    </p>

    <strong>Why Was it Created?</strong>

    <p>
    It was created by Gabriel Sidler and Geir Magnusson Jr of the Velocity
    community and Ted Husted of the Struts community to try and demonstrate that
    other presentation layer technologies can be used with the 
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/">Struts</a> web application
    framework.
