            <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/AbstractLockConfig.html">AbstractLockConfig</a>
            - This serves as a base class for tools who need to have
            their configuration be read-only for thread-safety or
            other reasons.  By default, tools which extend this can
            only be configured once.
            </p>
            <p>
            <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/LocaleConfig.html">LocaleConfig</a>
            - Subclass of AbstractLockConfig that has standardized
            support for configuring a Locale for the tool to use as
            its default.
            </p>
            <p>
            <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/FormatConfig.html">FormatConfig</a>
            - Subclass of FormatConfig that has standardized support
            for providing a format string value for the tool to use
            as its default.
            </p>

        <subsection name="Utility Classes">
            <p>
            <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/ClassUtils.html">ClassUtils</a>
            - Provides utility methods for loading classes,
            finding methods, accessing static field values,
            and more.
            </p>
            <p>
            <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/ConversionUtils.html">ConversionUtils</a>
            - Provides utility methods for common type
            conversions/value parsing.
            </p>
            <p>
            <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/view/ServletUtils.html">ServletUtils</a>
            - Utility methods for the servlet environment, mostly
            centered on accessing the VelocityView or tool instances
            handled thereby.
            </p>
            <p>
            <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/ValueParser.html">ValueParser</a>
            - Used to retrieve and parse (aka convert) String
            values pulled from a map; this is mostly commonly
            used directly by other tools rather than within
            templates.
