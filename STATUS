Known Issues/Bugs:
    - Nothing of note! :)



Documentation:
   - Complete user guide.
   - Document RenderTool, ViewRenderTool, IteratorTool, AbstractSearchTool,
              TilesTool, CookieTool, ActionMessagesTool, MultiViewsTool, 
              ValidatorTool, SecureLinkTool, and the commons-logging/LogSystem bridges
   - Create a developer's guide (how to write tools, tips on extending VVS, etc.)



Proposed Features/Upgrades:
    General:
        - convert project to use Maven
        - stop keeping jars in CVS
        
    VelocityView:
        - add a library of velocimacros for use with these tools
        - Switch to non-singleton mode of Velocity to allow different
          instances/configurations of VVS in the same classloader/application/JVM
        - Pluggable toolbox manager in VelocityViewServlet
        - Tool pooling support (use commons-pool probably)
        - add an ImportTool (for more info, see
          http://www.mail-archive.com/velocity-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg10047.html)
        - add ability to do custom, individual tool configurations 
          from the toolbox config file (pooling support might help here)

    Generic tools:
        - add a library of general-use velocimacros
        - Template debugging tool(s)/support
        - number formatting tool

    VelocityStruts:
        - add a library of velocimacros for use with struts tools
          (ideally these would be roughly parallel to struts tags to ease transition)
        - move dynamic javascript generation from java (ValidatorTool) to templates
          (this would probably work in concert with the velocimacro libraries)



Example Ideas:
   - a blank Velocity-Struts application as the starting point for development.
   - an application to demonstrate use of more obscure features like the 
     AbstractSearchTool, MultiViewsTool, IteratorTool, and the like.
   - Struts 1.1 example(s). Take the existing Struts 1.1 examples and replace 
     the view layer with Velocity. (show off Tiles, modules, Validator, etc.)
   - example app(s) to demonstrate the velocimacro libraries
   - self-documenting apps to explain and demonstrate key features
   - a FooShop-type demo app (i.e. something closer to real-world use)
