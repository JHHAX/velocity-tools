Known Issues/Bugs:
    - Configuration issues. Currently, the resource loader and the logger
        are hard-coded in VVS and overwrite the configuration in 
        Velocity.properties.  This is inflexible and confusing.
    - Inconsistent logging.  Some things (particularly the struts tools) use 
        Velocity's main logging mechanism while others log directly to 
        the ServletContext.  These are all velocity tools and should use
        Velocity's log system by default.



Documentation:
   - Fix current tools documentation. Several files are out of sync.
   - Drop the non-existent 'Utilities' package
   - Update plan for Velocimacro libraries
   - Complete user guide.
   - Create a developer's guide?



Proposed Features/Upgrades:
    VelocityView:
        - add a library of general velocimacros
        - Convert XMLToolboxManager to use commons' Digester
        - Pluggable toolbox manager in VelocityViewServlet

    VelocityTools:
        - Fold this library into VelocityView
        - add a library of velocimacros for use with these tools
        - Tool pooling support (use commons-pool probably)
        - Search/paging tool (from nathan)
        - Improved ToolLoader? (from Bill?)
        - Render/evaluate tool? (for perl or php prone people)
        - Template debugging tool(s)/support
        - add Denis' FisherMill for #foreach support (better name?)

    VelocityStruts:
        - add a library of velocimacros for use with struts tools
        - Struts 1.1 Support:
            - ActionMessages
                - add getActionMessages() to StrutsUtils
                - add ActionMessagesTool
            - Validator
                - tool to access javascripts?
                - integration with FormTool/MessagesTool?
            - Tiles
            - Modules (sub-apps)
            - multiple config files
            - multiple message resources
            - etc.



Examples:
   - Create a blank Velocity-Struts application as the starting point
     for development.
   - Create a simple Velocity-Struts application to demonstrate use
     of VelocityLayoutServlet (and any other newer features)
   - Create a Struts 1.1 example. Take one of the existing Struts 1.1
     examples and replace the view layer with Velocity.
   - Create example app(s) that demonstrate the use of other new features.
     (a macro-library example would be a good one to start with.)
