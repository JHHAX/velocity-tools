What is Here
============

view : A general-purpose servlet for rendering Velocity templates.
       There is no controller functionality - it's akin to the 
       JspServlet. It includes toolbox support. See view/README.txt
       for more information.

struts : Tools specific to integrating Velocity and Struts. See
       struts/README.txt for more information. There are serveral
       nice application examples included. Uses the view package.
       See struts/README.txt for more information.

tools : General purpose context tools.  Can be used with 'view' and
      'struts' of course. To be added soon.
