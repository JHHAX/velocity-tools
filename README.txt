Welcome to the VelocityTools projects. This project is an umbrella
for three subprojects:


VelocityServlet

    There is no controller functionality - it's akin to the 
    JspServlet. It includes toolbox support. See view/README.txt
    for more information.

VelocityLibrary

    A collection of general purpose view tools. See 
    library/REAMDE.txt for more information.

VelocityStruts

    Tools specific to integrating Velocity and Struts. See
    struts/README.txt for more information. There are several
    nice application examples included.
