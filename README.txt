What is Here
============

view : a general-purpose servlet for rendering Velocity templates.
       There is no controller functionality - it's akin to the 
       JspServlet.  It includes toolbox support.

struts : tools specific to integrating Velocity and Struts. To use
        build the jar from the 'view', and then from the struts
        tools.  See the excellent struts example.

tools : general purpose tools.  Can be used with 'view' and
        'struts' of course.
