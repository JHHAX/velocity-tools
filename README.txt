What is Here
============

view : a general-purpose servlet for rendering Velocity templates.
       There is no controller functionality - it's akin to the 
       JspServlet. It includes toolbox support.

struts : tools specific to integrating Velocity and Struts. See
       struts/README.txt for more information. There are serveral
       nice application examples included.

tools : general purpose tools.  Can be used with 'view' and
      'struts' of course. To be added soon.
