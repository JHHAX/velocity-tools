This app uses the extension custom tags and also uses the custom request processor (see the
struts-config for this app).  If the custom request processor is not used then the request will not
be redirected to the correct protocol if an action URL is manually entered into the browser with the
wrong protocol.

<br>
Look at the URLs specified for each link.  Note that the correct protocol is used for each, based
on the security specification in the config files.
